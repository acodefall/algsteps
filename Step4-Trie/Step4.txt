TRIE problems came in 2 types
	-Store meta-data in EOW node
	-Iterate the thread-of-words and print the each individual words found in that thread Ex:Newspaper
	-LCW

Standard solution will store the METADATA in a LIST object on the node used for representing the last letter of the WORD.
Examples are TopRated Keywords, PhoneDirectory, InvertedIndex, AnagramList.
    
    -In case of PhoneDirectory example, METADATA is the List of phone numbers associated with a person's name. 
     Say person "ABC" has two phone numbers 123 and 678. List object of Node-c will have '123' and '678'
    
    -In case of SuffixWordList example, if the user types 'new' then show the suffixes {news, newspaper}. METADATA is {news, newspaper}
    
    -In case of "Word occurence count" example, METADATA is occurence count
    
    -In case of "Anagrams" example, if the user types 'ART' then show {rat, art}. METADATA is {rat, art}
